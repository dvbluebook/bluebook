     <h2> <font color = "#022A6B" style = "font-family: verdana;"> Counselor and Teacher Recommendation Etiquette </font> </h2>
     Letters of recommendation are a critical part of the college admissions process. Every school
year, counselors and teachers generate hundreds of letters for our seniors. The number of letters
written has risen significantly in the past few years and we are happy to help our students by
writing a deserving letter on their behalf. As you may know, time is a very valuable component
to completing these letters. Please consider the following points as you approach your teachers
and counselor for a letter of recommendation.
        <ol>
            <li>School counselors are here to help. We understand there are a handful of us and so many
of you. We also are aware that many students have opted to go outside and seek the help
of an outside college advisor. Please take advantage of the resources we have on our
campus and make sure you are utilizing the many features of Naviance. These services
are invaluable tools and will help you in your college search. Even with an outside college
advisor, your school counselor must write your letter of recommendation so it is
important to develop a positive relationship and communicate regularly.
            </li>
            <li>Students are not entitled to letters of recommendation. Writing recommendations falls
outside the realm of teachers’ professional responsibilities. Many teachers enjoy writing
letters of recommendation, but it is important for students to know that writing one
letter can take over an hour, taking time away from both professional and personal
activities. Be respectful and considerate of their time.
            </li>
            <li>Always, always, always ask for a letter of recommendation in person and not via email.
            </li>
            <li>Provide all of the necessary information in an organized manner. Your counselor LOR
packet is due at least 30 school days prior to your first deadline and it is imperative that
you follow all of the instructions outlined in Naviance in the Document Library under
Counselor Checklist/LORs. If you have any questions, ask your counselor!
            </li>
            <li>Ask sooner rather than later. Again, please give teachers and counselors at least 30
school days prior to your first deadline to write your letter of recommendation.
Remember, we are writing countless letters for our seniors and need time to write them.
            </li>
            <li>A simple thank you note goes a long way. Please remember to personally thank your
teachers and counselors and follow-up with a simple note. It’s the little things that count.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <i>Thank you for following these guidelines. In return, you will benefit from quality letters
of recommendation.</i>
