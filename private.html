        California&#39;s nonprofit, independent colleges and universities establish their own admission
criteria and application procedures. Many have their own admission application, and most of
them offer online applications. Because California&#39;s nonprofit, independent colleges and
universities are not government funded, it is important that students wishing to apply contact
the colleges and universities of interest to determine specific requirements and deadlines.
        <BR></BR>
        Some California nonprofit, independent colleges and universities accept the &quot;Common
Application&quot; an application accepted by a number of independent colleges across the country. If
the schools to which you are applying accept the Common Application, be sure to check with
them directly to determine if there are additional application requirements.
