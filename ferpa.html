     <b>What is a FERPA Waiver?</b>
        <BR></BR>
        The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 is a federal law that
establishes the rights of students with regard to education records and ensures students
of the right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to those records. If a student gets
accepted to a college and decides to attend that college, the high school letters of
recommendations become part of a student’s record. A student who is accepted and is
attending, under FERPA, has the right to view these letters if one chooses to do so.
        <BR></BR>
        <b>To Waive or Not to Waive?</b>
        <BR></BR>
        It is the student’s choice; however, we recommend that a student clicks YES and waives
his/her right. Please consider:
        <ul>
        <li>Not waiving your right may raise some red flags to the colleges.</li>
            <li>Not waiving your right may appear as though you have something to hide.
            </li>
            <li>Colleges may feel your letter has more integrity if you waive your rights.</li>
            <li>Please trust that a teacher or counselor will not write a letter for you if they feel
they cannot represent you in the best way possible.
            </li>
            <li>Some educators will not write a letter if rights are not waived.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>How do I waive my rights?</b>
        <BR></BR>
        All students must waive their rights through the FERPA survey on Naviance. Students
applying to colleges through the Common Application must also sign the FERPA waiver
through the Common Application.
        <ul>
            <li>Naviance Family Connection: Under the <b>About Me</b> section, complete the
                <b>DVHS FERPA and Transcript Release Authorization</b> (on the far left). Once
submitting this survey, you may begin requesting official transcripts after 24
hours.
            </li>
            
            <li>Common Application: Log into your <b>Common App</b> account. Click on the <b>Recommenders and FERPA</b> tab for any school on your list. Click on the <b>Show details</b> link in the <b>FERPA Release Authorization</b> section. You will then be
able to make the change to your FERPA decision.
            </li>
