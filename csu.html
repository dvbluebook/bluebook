        <b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</b>
            <ol>
        
                <li><b>What high school courses do the CSUs require?</b></li>
                    To meet minimum eligibility requirements, students
must pass 15 one-year high school college-prep courses
with at least a C grade:
                <BR></BR>
a) 2 years of history/social science<BR></BR>
b) 4 years of English<BR></BR>
c) 3 years of math through at least Algebra II<BR></BR>
d) 2 years of laboratory science, including 1 biological,
and 1 physical science<BR></BR>
e) 2 years of the same world language<BR></BR>
f) 1 year of visual/performing arts<BR></BR>
g) 1 year of an elective chosen from the University of
California (UC) “A-G” list<BR></BR>
Students must take at least seven of these “A-G”
courses during their junior and senior years. Your high
school counselor will have a list of your school’s
courses that meet CSU requirements.
Most high schools also list their UC/CSU approved
                courses at <a href = https://hs-articulation.ucop.edu/guide target="_blank">hs-articulation.ucop.edu/guide</a>.
                
                <BR></BR>
                <li><b>How do the CSUs determine my eligibility?</b></li>
                CSUs use an “Eligibility Index” calculation to determine
your eligibility for admission. It is based on your grade point
average (GPA) in the “a–g” courses and scores on college
admissions tests (SAT/ACT). <b>2950 (SAT)</b> or <b>694 (ACT)</b> is
required to meet minimum eligibility for admission at a
CSU (see calculation below). Higher grades can offset lower test scores and vice versa.
                <BR></BR>
                <b><u>Calculating Eligibility:</u></b>
                <BR></BR>
                <b>ACT Scores:</b> (GPA) x 200 + (10 x ACT Composite)
                <BR></BR>
                <b>SAT Scores:</b> (GPA) x 800 + (SAT Score)
                
                <BR></BR>
                <li><b>How and when do I apply?</b>
                </li>
                Apply online at <a href = http://www.calstate.edu/apply target="_blank">calstate.edu/apply</a>.
                <BR></BR>
                Application filing period: October 1 through November 30.
                <BR></BR>
                <u>Note:</u> For some campuses, it is important to file early. For some campuses, you will need to select a major.
                <BR></BR>
