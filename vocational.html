     <h2> <font color = "#022A6B" style = "font-family: verdana;"> Vocational, Technical, and Career Colleges </font> </h2>
     There are over 10,000 private Vocational, Technical and Career Colleges located in the
U.S. Admission requirements for these schools vary, and the tuition costs range from
approximately $500 to $10,000 depending on the nature and length of the course.
Choosing a vocational school is a big decision. A key advantage to selecting a trade or
technical school is that training may be completed faster than at a community college,
although the expenses will be greater. Students typically will be required to take only
courses that relate to their specific area of training, rather than general education
courses.
        <BR></BR>
        <b>When choosing a Vocational School, ask:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the cost?</li>
                <li>How difficult is it?</li>
                <li>How long does it take?</li>
            </ul>
        <b>You may want to contact your school of choice and ask:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Is the school accredited? Accreditation is an important indicator because an
accredited school has passed a thorough examination of its business practices
and teaching ability by an accrediting agency.</li>
                <li>What percentage of the students finish the program?</li>
                <li>Is job placement included as a service of the school?</li>
                <li>Will a refund be given if the course is not completed?</li>
                <li>How long has the school been in operation?</li>
            </ul>
        <b>You also may want to talk to prospective employers and ask:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Would you hire graduates of the school?</li>
                <li>How many have you actually hired?</li>
                <li>Were they hired because of the schoolâ€™s training?</li>
                <li>Did training make a difference in starting salary?</li>
                <li>Will there be jobs available for the skills taught at the trade school?</li>
            </ul>
        <b>Obtain information from various sources by:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Visiting the school itself.</li>
                <li>Checking with local community colleges to see if similar training is available at a
lower cost. Further information on Trade/Technical Schools can be found in the
                    DVHS College and Career Center and online at: <a href = http://www.trade-schools.net target="_blank">trade-schools.net</a> or
