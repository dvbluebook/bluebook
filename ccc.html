        <b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</b>
        <ol>
            <li><b>What do community colleges offer?</b></li>
            Community colleges provide career programs in
hundreds of areas, such as technical and industrial
trades, health occupations, business and finance,
electronics and computer sciences, agriculture,
police and fire, food science, and building and
landscaping. Depending on the occupation,
training may take from six months to two years.
Associate degrees and certificate programs are
available for many fields. Students who want to
earn a four-year degree may choose to first go to a
community college for a number of reasons, such
as:
<ul>
    <li>Close to home</li>
    <li>Lower cost</li>
<li>More time to explore their options and interests</li>
<li>Smaller classes and more direct contact
    with faculty</li>
            <li>Higher acceptance rates for transfers than</li>
freshman at most universities
    <li>Potential for guaranteed admissions</li>
    </ul>
            
            <BR></BR>
            <li><b>Who attends community college?</b>
            </li>
            Community college is designed for students who
are seeking a technical/career certificate, a two-
year associate’s degree, or credits to transfer to a
four-year university to obtain a bachelor’s
degree. Students may also take courses to
enhance their job skills, improve their
knowledge of basic English or math, and for personal enrichment or enjoyment. Community
colleges attract students with a broad range of
backgrounds, abilities, and interests. Most
community college students work as well as go
to school. Many students are the first in their
family to attend college or are raising a family
while attending school. Only about a quarter of
all students attend college full time. Community
college students reflect a wide range of ages,
with about half younger than 25 and a fifth
            
            <BR></BR>
    <li><b>Are all community colleges the same?</b></li>
            Each of the 113 community colleges in
California are distinct and reflects the area
where it is located. All try to meet the
needs of all students. However, some
colleges—particularly those in regions with
multiple colleges—specialize in specific
areas. If there are two or more colleges
near your home, learn how they differ in
terms of the career programs they offer
and their transfer agreements with
California State University (CSU) or
University of California (UC) campuses.
Often the college’s course catalog can be
downloaded from the Internet. In
addition, you should make an appointment
with your high school and/or community
college counselor to find out what your
local colleges offer. It’s also a good idea
            
            <BR></BR>
    <li><b>How do I apply?</b></li>
            Contact the admissions office of the
college you would like to attend. To get
a copy of the application visit 
            <a href = http://www.cccapply.org target="_blank">cccapply.org</a>. There you can apply
to many colleges through a common
online application and link directly to
college websites for those colleges that
require their own application.
Also make an appointment with the
college’s counseling office. Many
courses, particularly entry-level
required classes, fill up quickly. To
make sure you get the courses you
want, ask your high school counselor
about the best time to apply—typically
spring or early summer. Some students
begin college in the summer to get a
head start. Some colleges offer a short
orientation class that includes help in
signing up for classes. If students take
that class in the summer, they have an
advantage over the freshmen who will
enter college in the fall.
            
            <BR></BR>
    <li><b>What if I am uncertain about what
career I want to pursue?</b></li>
            Community colleges offer many
opportunities to explore careers. If you are
unsure whether you want to go to a four-
year university, for example, you can keep
your options open by carefully planning
your schedule. Many courses that fulfill
requirements for an associate’s degree also
meet the prerequisites if you want to
transfer to UC or CSU campuses.
Typically, there are fewer community
college courses accepted by UC than CSU,
and fewer accepted by CSU than for an
associate’s degree. For example, if you
need to take a math course, choose one
that meets the criteria for all three: UC,
CSU, and an associate’s degree.
All students entering community college
should meet with one of the college’s
counselors to plan their schedules. It is
even more important to do so if you are
not sure which university you want to
attend and/or what major you want to pursue.
           
            <BR></BR>
    <li><b>Is financial help available?</b></li>
            Some students can receive fee waivers
and assistance with books and living
costs, such as housing. Visit the
financial aid office at your community
college and ask about the BOG waiver,
grants, low-interest loans, work-study
(on or off-campus) and scholarships.
