     Helpful links are available for you to utilize on the LEFT side of the Naviance Family Connection
        home page (e.g., FAFSA, Cal Grant, etc.). In the <b>Colleges</b> section, scroll to the bottom and you will

            Financial Aid is money that is supplied by outside sources to help pay for the cost of an education
beyond high school. Financial Aid comes from Four Sources: The Federal Government, our State
Government, the school that you attend after high school, and private companies and
organizations.
            <BR></BR>
            <b>There are two basic categories of financial aid: Need-Based and Non-Need Based.</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Merit-Based Aid</b> is given to students in recognition of special skills, talents or academic
ability and is often competitive in nature.</li>
                    <li><b>Need-Based Aid</b> is the largest portion of Financial Aid. When a family does not have
sufficient resources to pay for an education beyond high school, they are considered to have
financial need. Approximately 80% of full-time students will receive some form of Need-
Based Financial Aid. Student received need-based aid upon completing the Free Application
for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The deadline to complete FAFSA application is open
October 1-June 30; however you may need to submit the form earlier to meet a college’s
financial aid deadline. Federal work-study dollars and many state and institutional grants
and scholarships are awarded to students who apply the earliest.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <b>There are four types of financial aid: grants, loans, work study, and scholarships.</b>
                <ul>
            
                    <li><b>Grants:</b> provided by both the
Federal and State Government. This is free
money, and does not need to be paid back.</li>
                    
                    <li><b>Loans:</b> provided mostly from
private banks and even though you will most
likely receive a low interest loan, it is still a
loan and must be paid back with interest.</li>
                    
                    <li><b>Work Study Program:</b> offered
through your college of choice. If you are able
to get involved with the Work Study Program,
you will receive a job either on or off campus
and your pay will be used towards your
tuition and college fees. This is a great way to
pay as you go…Some advice, as soon as you
have been accepted, contact the Financial Aid
Office and get your name on the list for the
Work Study Program.</li>
                
                    <li><b>Scholarships:</b> available from various
sources. Some will be based on need, others on
achievement or special talents like academic
success, athletic skills and music or community
service involvement. Web sites, parent’s work
place, and here at Dougherty Valley High
School are just a few places in which you can
find scholarships and/or scholarship
information.</li>

            Scholarships are free money, but they do require a lot of research, time, patience, and
persistence. The scholarships will not come search for YOU. Students who have been most
successful in the process are those who have tirelessly search the free services to the sites
above, checked by Naviance Family Connection regularly and applied consistently, and just
continued to RESEARCH, RESEARCH, RESEARCH, and APPLY, APPLY, APPLY!
