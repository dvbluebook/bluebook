                <li><b>How and when do I apply?</b></li>
                Beginning on August 1st, you can apply online at

opportunity to introduce yourself to the people reading
your application.

                <b>This is NOT an essay. This is an interview on

                    <BR></BR>
                <b>Be open, be honest, be real.</b> What you say gives
readers the context to better understand the rest of the
information you’ve provided in your application.
