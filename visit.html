         While this may be the standard procedure, colleges are trying to make these visits more available as the situation
     changes due to the pandemic. Therefore, some of the information below may not apply to this year.
     <BR></BR>
     Visiting a college campus is a very important part of the college planning process. While
reading and researching online is a great start, it’s difficult to really get the feel for a
school until you spend time on the actual campus.
        <BR></BR>
        The best time to visit is when the school is in session and students are on campus.
Usually visiting on a Monday-Thursday will give you the best idea of a typical day. Most
campuses also offer information sessions and tours year round. Call or visit the college’s
Admissions website before your intended visit for specific tour times and meeting
places. After taking a campus tour, make sure to leave time to explore the campus on
your own.
        <BR></BR>
