     <ol>
         <li><b>What is a College Entrance Exam?</b><BR></BR>A college entrance exam is a type of standardized test that asks you questions in several
key areas, such as reading, math, science and English. There are two major college
entrance exams, the SAT and the ACT. Although the criteria differ somewhat, colleges
do not have a preference between either exam. The questions include information
presented to students up until their junior or senior years in high school. Many colleges
will use those scores to determine admission decisions. Additionally colleges and
universities may use these scores to determine scholarships and honors programs.</li>
         <BR></BR>
         <li><b>Which test should I take?</b><BR></BR>The ACT and SAT are seen as completely equal options to fulfill the standardized testing
requirement. You can choose which test to take based on your personal preference. It is
unnecessary to take an official exam in both tests since every college will accept either
score. Studies have shown that students who prepare for a single test earn 50% greater
score than student who divide their time between exams. Previous studies have found
that about 85% of students score approximately the same on both tests. To determine
which test to officially take, try a full-length practice exam if possible. If you like one test
better, or more likely, dislike one test less, then focus your efforts on that specific exam.
Lastly, there are plenty of free practice exams taking place in the area. There are sample
             practices tests on both the <a href = http://www.collegeboard.org target="_blank">College Board website</a> and the <a href = http://www.actstudent.org target="_blank">ACT website</a>, as well as in the DVHS
College and Career Center.</li><BR></BR>
         <li><b>When should I take the test?</b><BR></BR>Students ought to orient themselves toward official test dates in 11 th grade or fall of
senior year and avoid preparation during freshman or sophomore year. This is because
students do not receive the full benefit of academic and emotional maturation until later
in high school, which can have a significant impact on test scores. Students may take the
PSAT sophomore and/or junior year to get your base SAT score. Taking the PSAT
(Practice SAT) as a sophomore is a great way to get introduced to the test in a
completely no-pressure situation – you aren’t qualified for the National Merit
competition until junior year, so you can just get an introduction to the test and get a
sense of where you stand with your current skills. Then you may begin studying the
summer following sophomore year, and take the SAT junior year in the Fall or early
Spring.</li>
         <BR></BR>
         <li><b>How many times should I take the test?</b><BR></BR>There is no limit to the number of times you may take either test. The number of times
you should take a college entrance exam really depends on you. You generally want to
take the test twice and see if you can better your score on the second attempt. According
to The Princeton Review, you should take one test no more than three times. But keep in
mind, there is no guarantee that a student&#39;s scores will improve. If you took any of the
practice tests offered in the area, you have some idea of how well you will score.</li>
         <BR></BR>
         <li><b>What is a "good score"?</b><BR></BR>There is no one good score. Work with the College and Career Center or use Google to
search your target or goal schools and their “interquartile ranges” (25 th to 75 th percentile
test scores of accepted students). Target the 75 th percentile (upper end of the quartile
range). Remember that the 75 th percentile test score for a school does not guarantee
admission but gives you a good sense of what your testing score goal should be.</li>
         <BR></BR>
         <li><b>What is a superscore?</b><BR></BR>Many schools will ask you to list the score and test date of your best individual test scores
from a section—such as your best English, best Math, best Reading, and best Science scores,
even if they are from separate test dates—and then calculate a “super composite” or
superscore based on these scores. Therefore, if you worry that some scores will rise as
others fall when you take the ACT or SAT again, the superscore will reflect your best results.</li>
         <BR></BR>
         <li><b>What colleges superscore?</b><BR></BR>Most colleges, but not all, consider your SAT or ACT superscores.* Find out the policy for
each school you apply to, so that you can come up with the best application and testing
strategy. Some schools highly recommend that you send all test scores (even if only your
highest section scores will factor into their admissions decision), so that they can make sure
you are considered for other opportunities like honors college admission, scholarships, or
             bridge programs.<BR></BR>*The University of California and California State University systems do not superscore.
They require you to send all your test scores, but will only consider your best test score from
a same test date for admission.</li>
         <BR></BR>
         <li><b>What can I do to get ready for the test?</b><BR></BR>There are no shortcuts to doing well- it takes time, effort, and deliberate practice. One of
the best ways to prepare for an entrance exam is to have good study habits in the
classroom. For example, if you are taking Algebra II, this math content will appear on
both the SAT and ACT. You also are almost certainly reading and analyzing works from
various genres in English classes, as well as mastering the 5 paragraph persuasive essay.
In other words, your high school classes are preparing you for college and the tests are
identifying those students who are best prepared to do well in college. So students who
create strong study habits and perform well in those classes are already preparing for
the exams and therefore for college. Additionally, it is important to develop a growth
mindset toward the test preparation process. Increasing an ACT or SAT score is not
easy, so students must be able to maintain confidence even as they face obstacles.</li>
         <BR></BR>
         <li><b>Are there any classes I can take to help me prepare?</b><BR></BR>There are several options for ACT and/or SAT preparation including self-guided prep
(software programs, books, and websites), group courses, and tutoring. Whether any or
all of these can help improve your chances of obtaining your desired score is something
you and your family should consider for your particular circumstances. Please contact
the DVHS College and Career Center to discuss available resources.</li>
         <BR></BR>
         <li><b>What happens to my scores once I take the SAT or ACT?</b><BR></BR>A copy of your score report will be sent to you and the colleges you list on your
registration form (optional). Your scores will be shared only with those you want them
to be shared with. You may also request your scores to be sent later to colleges and
universities directly from the ACT and/or College Board websites once you have decided
where you are planning to apply. There will be no cost for the first four colleges you
request scores to be sent. For every college after the first four, ACT and the College
Board each charges $12 per score report.</li>
         <BR></BR>
         <li><b>What if I don't know which college or university I want my scores to be sent to?</b><BR></BR>Both the ACT and the SAT allow test takers to send their scores to several different
organizations, including scholarship programs, colleges, and universities. Even if you
are not certain which schools you want to attend, you can send your scores to those that
you think you are most likely to attend. However, it will be more cost effective to wait
and send your score reports once you are certain where you will be applying, and before
those application deadlines.</li>
         <BR></BR>
         <li><b>What is the PSAT?</b><BR></BR>The PSAT is a preliminary, or practice, SAT. The PSAT is given only in October for
sophomores and juniors at Dougherty Valley High School. The PSAT is like a
scrimmage; it does not count, but you get test practice and score feedback to help plan
for the SAT. PSAT scores do not show up on the SAT score report that the student sends
with his or her admissions application to colleges. So take it if you can, you have nothing
to lose and much insight to gain. Juniors may also qualify for the National Merit
Scholarship if they score in the top 5% of 11 th grade test takers in the state of California.</li>
         <BR></BR>
         <li><b>Do I have to take the PSAT to get into college?</b><BR></BR>No, the PSAT is not a prerequisite for any college, nor will colleges consider this score
for admission purposes. PSAT scores may be used by some scholarship qualifying
criteria for juniors (National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test).</li>
