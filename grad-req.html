     <h2> <font color = "#022A6B" style = "font-family: verdana;"> High School Graduation Requirements </font> </h2>
     
        <h4>Graduation = 220 credits!</h4>
            <b>Am I on track?</b>
        <p>Look at your transcript under the credit summary box. On the column that reads
            “Earned”:<BR></BR>
= 160 : You are right on track! You must earn 60 credits in your senior year towards the
            correct subject areas (six classes each semester) and you will graduate.<BR></BR>
            &gt; 160 : You are ahead of credits for graduation! District policy still requires that students
enroll in 6 classes, but you are in great shape for graduation.
<BR></BR>
&lt; 160 : You are behind in credits for graduation. Please see your counselor as soon as
possible to ensure you are eligible for graduation and able to make-up credits (adding
on an “A” period).</p>
        
            <b>What if I fail a class in my senior year?</b>
        <p>Depending on the number of credits you have earned and the timeframe you have to
make-up credits, you may still have a chance to graduate. But, you must speak with your
counselor as soon as you find yourself in danger of failing.</p>
        
            <b>Can I still participate in graduation if I make up the credits during the summer after my senior year?</b>
        <p>No, you must complete all 220 credits by the end of your second semester of senior year
in order to participate in the DVHS graduation ceremony.</p>
        
            <b>What if I want to drop a class and/or change my schedule?</b>
        <p>You must ensure that dropping a class or changing your schedule does not impact
graduation. (i.e. dropping a class in a required subject area or losing total credits by
dropping). If you have reported your senior courses on your college application, this
means your application status (or conditional acceptance- depending on when you
would like to drop a course) may be affected by this. You, the student, will need to contact all of the college admissions offices that you applied to and ask: <i>“Will dropping
“X” course impact my college application status/conditional acceptance?”</i> Each office
will be able to answer this question.</p>
        
            <b>Senioritis: what is it and how do I avoid it?</b>
        <p>Senioritis: noun. A crippling disease that is subject to strike high school seniors. It tends
to manifest itself about halfway through the first semester, waiting for winter vacation.
Symptoms include: laziness, procrastination, an overall lack of concern for style (sweats,
flip flops, and sometimes lack of hygiene). Also features a lack of studying, repeated
absences, and a generally dismissive attitude. The only known cure is a phenomenon
known as graduation. It can be contagious, so stay focused and support each other!
There is a light at the end of the tunnel!</p>
