     <h2> <font color = "#022A6B" style = "font-family: verdana;"> High School Graduation Requirements </font> </h2>
     
        <h4>Graduation = 220 credits!</h4>
            <b>As a senior, am I on track?</b>
        <p>Look at your transcript under the credit summary box. On the column that reads
            “Earned”:<BR></BR>
= 160 : You are right on track! You must earn 60 credits in your senior year towards the
            correct subject areas (six classes each semester) and you will graduate.<BR></BR>
            &gt; 160 : You are ahead of credits for graduation! District policy still requires that students enroll in 6 classes, but you are in great shape for graduation.<BR></BR>
&lt; 160 : You are behind in credits for graduation. Please see your counselor as soon as
possible to ensure you are eligible for graduation and able to make-up credits (adding
on an “A” period).</p>
     <p> You need 220 credits in total to graduate. They are divided into:
      <ul>
       <li> History/Social Sciences: 35 credits
        <ul>
          <li> 5 credits of World Geography</li>
         <li> 10 credits of World/European History</li>
         <li> 10 credits of US History</li>
         <li> 5 credits of Government</li>
         <li> 5 credits of Economics</li>
       </ul> </li>
       
       <li> English: 40 credits
       <ul>
        <li> 10 credits per year</li>
        </ul></li>
       
       <li> Mathematics: 20 credits
       <ul>
        <li> Minimum requirement: must complete Algebra 1 (or equivalent course from outside the District such as Integrated Math 1).</li>
        </ul></li>
       
       <li> Science: 20 credits
       <ul>
        <li> 10 credits of Life Science </li>
        <li> 10 credits of Physical Science</li>
        </ul></li>
       
       <li> World Languages/Visual and Performing Arts/Career Tech and Applied Arts: 20 credits
       <ul>
        <li> 10 credits in two of the above three areas</li>
        </ul></li>
       
       <li> Physical Education: 20 credits
       <ul>
        <li> 10 credits of PE 9 and completion of the Fitnessgram test</li>
        <li> 10 credits of another PE class taken in 10th-12th grades</li>
        </ul></li>
       
       <li> Health: 5 credits</li>
       
       <li> Additional "electives"/classes: 60 credits</li>
       
     </ul>
     </p>
        
            <b>What if I fail a class in my senior year?</b>
        <p>Depending on the number of credits you have earned and the timeframe you have to
make-up credits, you may still have a chance to graduate. But, you must speak with your
counselor as soon as you find yourself in danger of failing.</p>
        
            <b>Can I still participate in graduation if I make up the credits during the summer after my senior year?</b>
        <p>No, you must complete all 220 credits by the end of your second semester of senior year
in order to participate in the DVHS graduation ceremony.</p>
        
            <b>What if I want to drop a class and/or change my schedule?</b>
        <p>You must ensure that dropping a class or changing your schedule does not impact
graduation. (i.e. dropping a class in a required subject area or losing total credits by
dropping). If you have reported your senior courses on your college application, this
means your application status (or conditional acceptance- depending on when you
would like to drop a course) may be affected by this. You, the student, will need to contact all of the college admissions offices that you applied to and ask: <i>“Will dropping
“X” course impact my college application status/conditional acceptance?”</i> Each office
will be able to answer this question.</p>
        
            <b>Senioritis: what is it and how do I avoid it?</b>
        <p>Senioritis: noun. A crippling disease that is subject to strike high school seniors. It tends
to manifest itself about halfway through the first semester, waiting for winter vacation.
Symptoms include: laziness, procrastination, an overall lack of concern for style (sweats,
flip flops, and sometimes lack of hygiene). Also features a lack of studying, repeated
absences, and a generally dismissive attitude. The only known cure is a phenomenon
known as graduation. It can be contagious, so stay focused and support each other!
There is a light at the end of the tunnel!</p>
