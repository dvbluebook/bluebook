     <h2> <font color = "#022A6B" style = "font-family: verdana;"> Application Types </font> </h2>
     Most universities use electronic application portals. The most common options are the Common
Application, the Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success, and some colleges and
university systems use their own application portals (e.g. the University of California system and
California State University system).
        <BR></BR>
        <b>The Common Application (<a href = http://www.commonapp.org target="_blank">commonapp.org</a>):</b>
        <BR></BR>
        The Common Application is an undergraduate
college admission application that students may
use to apply to any of the member colleges and
universities. There are around 700 colleges in
the US and abroad that accept the Common
App, which allows a student to complete one application for multiple universities, however some
colleges and universities have supplemental material. <b>Due to familiarity and technical
procedures, the DVHS Counseling department encourages students to apply using
        the Common App rather than The Coalition.</b>
        <BR></BR>
        <b>The Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success (<a href = http://www.coalitionforcollegeaccess.org target="_blank">coalitionforcollegeaccess.org</a>):</b>
        <BR></BR>
        The Coalition Application was created in 2015 and became available for submission in the Fall of
2016. The intent of The Coalition, which currently has over 130 member colleges and
universities, is to make the college application process simpler and more accessible. The system
allows you to store school work, resources, materials,
projects, or videos to a private student locker that can
be shared with a counselor or mentor for review. The
locker is an optional feature that can be used at any
time during your high school career. All universities
using the Coalition Application offer either affordable
tuition or have agreed to meet 100% of a studentâ€™s demonstrated need. The University of Washington, University of Maryland, and University of
Florida exclusively use the Coalition application.
