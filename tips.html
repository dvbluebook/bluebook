        <ul>
            <li><b>Read all application instructions carefully.</b> If they only accept one letter of recommendation, then only send one. Sending more will only prove you did not read the instructions.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Our school code (CEEB)</b>: 053-218
            </li>
            
            <li><b>SAT and ACT scores must be sent directly from College Board or ACT.</b>
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Pay close attention to your deadlines.</b> It is your responsibility to make sure your teachers and counselor are aware of your deadlines. Please alert them if any changes are made.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Use your legal name</b> on all documents and be consistent.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Maintain a copy of all usernames, passwords, and PIN numbers</b> in the same place for easy reference. These will add up quickly. See the <a href = passwords.html>Passwords page</a>.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Proofread what you write!</b> Do not wait until the last minute to write your essays. Take your time and ask for feedback.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Request your transcripts in a timely manner.</b> Again, this is your responsibility. If you have not printed out and turned in the confirmation page of your transcript requests from Naviance Family Connection to the Counseling office, we assume you do not need one sent.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Update all information</b> in Naviance Family Connection on a regular basis.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>E-mail:</b> Please use a “professional” email when applying to college. rockstar@yahoo.com is not an appropriate email address. Colleges may contact you via email for additional information or updates on their admission procedures.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Student Portal (once you have applied):</b> It is the student’s responsibility to check the student portal with each college campus. This is the primary means of communication between you and the colleges you are applying to.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Self-Reporting DVHS Grades:</b> Unofficial transcripts are available in the parent portal in Infinite Campus (IC), our Student Information System database. Use these transcripts as a reference to report accurate semester grades. This is most applicable for universities such as: University of California, California State Universities, Arizona State University, Penn State, Purdue, University of Arizona, University of Washington, Washington State University, University of Hawaii, etc.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Once you recieve decisions from different schools:</b> Research the schools you were accepted to as much as possible! To narrow down your options and decide between schools, consider the institution's affiliation, academic reputation, program or major, academic support services, academic facilities, retention and graduation rates, location, finances, campus environment, and activities.</li>
