        <b>Spring of Junior Year
        </b>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure to keep your grades up! Colleges will look closely at your junior grades. <i>For some schools, this is the last semester of grades that they will see prior to making an admissions decision.</i>
                </li>
                
                <li>Take the SAT, or the ACT, and SAT subject tests as applicable.
                </li>
                
                <li>Sign up for any Advanced Placement tests you are planning to take through the <a href = https://doughertyvalleyhs.revtrak.net target="_blank">DVHS Webstore</a>.
                </li>
                
                <li>Review the transcript that was handed out during counselor presentations in English classes.  You should have at least 150 credits at the end of the 1st semester of junior year. <i><u>Please note:</u> if you earned a D or F in an academic course in high school, that grade will need to be remediated for college applications/high school graduation. Grades of D’s do not count for four year colleges, but do earn credit towards high school graduation. Discuss remediation options with your counselor.</i>
                </li>
                
                <li>During your one-on-one meeting with your counselor in March/April, discuss your senior year courses, your college plans, your academic progress, and summer school, if necessary.
                </li>
                
                <li>Participate in college-related workshops offered through the DVHS College and Career Center. Check the School Loop newsfeed, Naviance, and the College and Career Center Monthly Newsletter for workshop details.
                </li>
                
                <li>Review your results from the <b>Do What You Are</b> and <b>Career Cluster Finder</b> in Naviance Family Connection under the <b>Careers tab</b>. Make sure to complete these assessments if you have not yet done so.

                <li>Complete the <b>SuperMatch College Search</b> tool in Naviance Family Connection. To access this program, log on to your Naviance Family Connection account. Then click on SuperMatch under the <b>Colleges</b> tab. “Pin” to save your results.
                </li>
                
                <li>Use the <b>College Match</b> section of Naviance Family Connection to see additional colleges that other students apply to who also apply to the schools on your preliminary list.
                </li>
                
                <li>For assistance with interpreting results from your surveys in Naviance Family Connection, see Mrs. Wright in the College and Career Center.
                </li>
                
                <li>CAASPP Testing: there is an additional Early Assessment Program (EAP) portion of the ELA and Math CAASPP tests. This will test your college readiness in English and Math for the CSUs and Community Colleges. <u>Please note:</u> if a student scores “Conditional Exempt” or “Non-Exempt” on the ELA portion of test, <i>they will be placed into Expository Reading and Writing (ERWC)</i> in order to meet college freshman eligibility requirements for the CSUs and most community colleges.
                </li>
                
                <li>Research the colleges on your preliminary list by visiting college websites and doing virtual tours, checking out view books, pod-casts, and videos, and reading blogs, books, and magazines about colleges. If you are aware of the career field you would like to pursue, research the course work that is required for that major.  Multiple publications are available in the College and Career Center. Begin to build a list of colleges you are considering in the <b>Colleges</b> tab of Naviance Family Connection under “Colleges I’m Thinking About”.
                </li>
                
                <li>Use the results of your research to begin to narrow the size of your list of colleges. Use the <b>Compare Colleges</b> section of Naviance Family Connection to help you compare schools. 
                </li>
                
                <li>Discuss your career/college plans with your parents. Make sure to include a frank discussion about finances in your talks.  Check out the <a href = http://www.finaid.org target="_blank">FinAid website</a> for information about college expenses and financial aid.
                </li>
                
                <li>Visit colleges that interest you. You can arrange visits and tours by contacting college admissions departments. Make sure to sit in on a class or two if you can. Try to get off of the beaten path of the tour and really observe the students and instructors. Take advantage of opportunities to interview with admissions officers or professors. 
                </li>
                
                <li>If you are considering colleges that require a letter of recommendation: Identify at least two academic teachers that you would like to write letters of recommendation to colleges for you. Be aware that colleges prefer letters from your junior year teachers. Ask the teachers if they will write recommendations for you before summer vacation or the beginning of your senior year (August). You will need to fill out a questionnaire for each teacher from whom you are requesting a letter. Please note: You will <u><i>not</i></u> need a letter of recommendation for University of California schools (UCs) or California State Universities (CSUs).
                </li>
                
                <li>Talk with graduating seniors about the colleges they will be attending. Ask them how they made their choices, what the admissions process was like, and which other colleges they considered.
                </li>
                
                <li>Plan additional college visits for the summer.

Be sure to also submit a transcript to NCAA as well and inform your counselor that this is your plan.
                </li>

        <b>Summer before Senior Year
        </b>
            <ul>
                <li>Find out which of the colleges you would like to apply that accept the Common Application (<a href = http://www.commonapp.org target="_blank">commonapp.org</a>). Both the Common App and University of California applications will be available to begin completing on August 1. Do NOT complete the application any earlier as your account will not rollover into the academic year you are applying for.
                </li>
                
                <li>Visit the websites of any schools that do not accept the Common Application and begin filling out application forms. You should print out your applications and check them before you submit them electronically.
                </li>
                
                <li>Begin working on your college application essays. For tips on writing good college application essays check out the College Board resources at the <a href = http://www.collegeessayguy.com/college-essay-resources target="_blank">College Essay Guy website</a>. Also, under “Links” found on the Naviance Family Connection homepage, click on “UC Information”; here you will find helpful tips for applying to the UC as well as tips for writing the UC Personal Insight Questions – if you are applying to the UCs. <u>Please note:</u> CSUs do not require essays. 
                </li>
                
                <li>Schedule campus visits and interviews for any college you’re interested in that you did not visit in the spring. Schedule second visits to colleges that you want to see again. You should try to arrange an overnight stay for second or third visits.
                </li>
                
                <li>If you are planning to pursue a major in the arts, start compiling your portfolio or preparing for your audition.
                </li>
                
                <li>If needed, register to take the SAT or ACT in the fall. It is recommended that you register early as colleges will have either a November or December test date deadline (be sure you research this deadline with your specific colleges). Be prepared to indicate at least four colleges to receive your scores on the day of your exam. You will be charged a fee for schools that are added later. Please note: When sending scores to a UC: scores sent to one campus will be shared with <i>all</i> campuses IF you allow UCs to share information about you by checking a box on the UC application. When sending scores to CSUs, scores sent to one campus will be shared with <i>all</i> CSU campuses.
                </li>
                
                <li>Make a list of all of your application requirements and deadlines; be sure to stick to those deadlines.
                </li>
                
                <li>Set up an email account that is not spam-guarded, that you will check often, and that is appropriate for college admissions (e.g., <u>hotchick@gmail.com</u> and <u>rockstar@yahoo.com</u> are examples of emails that are not appropriate for college).
                </li>
                
                <li>Begin searching for scholarships. You should check the <b>Scholarship List</b> in Family Connection on a regular basis until you graduate. There are new scholarships added to the list almost every week. Be sure to sort your search for local scholarships to maximize your chance of winning. You should also use sites such as <a href = http://fastweb.com target="_blank">fastweb.com</a>, <a href = http://scholarships.com target="_blank">scholarships.com</a>, or <a href = http://www.bigfuture.collegeboard.org target="_blank">College Board: Big Future Scholarship Search</a> to search for national scholarships.

                <li>If you are requesting letters of recommendation from teachers, you must complete a <b>Teacher Letter of Recommendation Forms</b> for each teacher/subject you are requesting. Click on <b>Document Library</b> on the homepage and then click on <b>(Department Name) Teacher Questionnaire</b>. Please do not supply your teacher with your responses to the Student and Parent Questionnaires. This will result in all of your letters sounding the same, which will not benefit your application.
                </li>
                
                <li>Begin viewing the college representative visit schedule (found under the <b>Colleges tab</b> under <b>Upcoming College Visits</b>) on Family Connection. Sign up on Naviance Family Connection to visit with the representatives of colleges that interest you.
