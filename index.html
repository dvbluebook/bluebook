     Dear Senior,
     <BR> <BR>
      You have made it to your last year of high school! We know this is a very exciting and busy time for you, so we have compiled a guide to help you as you navigate your year. The DVHS Counselors and College & Career Center are here to help you along the way.
     <BR> <BR>
      Our goal is to make this process manageable and understandable for you and your family. Use this website as a starting place and a reference guide, but remember to meet with your counselor frequently. Your counselor can individualize the search to meet your needs to make sure that your college list reflects your interests and goals.
     <BR> <BR>
      This is not a sprint, but a year-long process to pace yourself. Take a deep breath and enjoy the process.
