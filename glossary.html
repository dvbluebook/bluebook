help colleges evaluate how ready students are for college-level work. The ACT and the College
Board’s SAT are two standardized admission tests used in the United States. The word

accept the offer of admission if given admittance, until the May 1 response deadline.
        
        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Early Decision (ED):</b> An option to submit an application to your first-choice college before the regular deadline. When

ED II, which has a later application deadline than their regular ED plan.
        
        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Financial Aid:</b> Money given or loaned to you to help pay for college. Financial aid can come from federal and

        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA):</b> FAFSA is a free online form required by the government for application to any federal education
aid program. FAFSA is used to determine the expected family contribution based on family
financial information and can contribute to a student’s total financial aid package for a college.
        
        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Grade Point Average (GPA):</b> A number that shows overall academic performance. It’s computed by assigning a point value to

    <b>Grants:</b> Payments made to students by various organizations, including Cal Grants from the State of
California or Pell Grants from the Federal Government. Apply via FAFSA and/or CSS/Financial

        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Impacted Major/College:</b> A college degree program, such a Business or Nursing, in which more students apply than the

        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Master of Arts (MA) or Master of Science (MS):</b> A college graduate degree usually requiring one or two years of work beyond a bachelor’s degree.
This is also known as a Graduate degree.
        
        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Need-Blind Admission:</b> A policy of making admission decisions without considering the financial circumstances of
applicants. Colleges that use this policy may not offer enough financial aid to meet a student’s
full need.
        
        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Net Price Calculator:</b> An automated tool on each college’s financial aid website which gives the net price, or the
estimated amount that a student pays to attend an institution in a single academic year after
subtracting scholarships and grants that a student receives. This tool will also give an estimated
amount of loans a student may qualify for upon submitting FAFSA.
        
        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Placement Tests:</b> Tests that measure the academic skills needed for college-level work. They cover reading,
writing, math and sometimes other subjects. Placement tests results help determine what
courses a student is ready for and whether he or she would benefit from remedial classes.
        
        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Prerequisites:</b> Courses, test scores, and/or grade level that must be completed before taking a specific course.

financial aid — must be received to be given the strongest consideration.
        
        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Reserve Officer's Training Corps (ROTC):</b> Many colleges have programs that offer two or four year military training culminating in an
officer’s commission. ROTC scholarships are available to pay for full college tuition. Generally
once a student graduates from an ROTC program, he or she is obligated to the military for an
equivalent number of years as he or she was supported by the government.
        
        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>Rolling Admission:</b> An admission policy of considering each application as soon as all required information (such as
high school records and test scores) has been received, rather than setting an application
deadline and reviewing applications in a batch. Colleges that use a rolling admission policy
usually notify applicants of admission decisions within a few weeks.
        
        <BR></BR>
        
    <b>SAT:</b> The College Board’s standardized college admission test. As of March 2016, the exam features

    <b>SAT Subject Tests:</b> Hour-long, content-based college admission tests that allow students to showcase achievement
in 21 different subject areas such as English, history, math, science and languages. Some

        <BR></BR>

        <BR></BR>
